# KeralaCovid

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.3.
It is a simple dashboard that displays Covid data like Number of Active Cases,Recovered, Deaths, etc. from the API. It contains both State-wide data as an overview and a detailed district-wise data.

Data API - https://api.covid19india.org

The API repository remains inactive after 13th August 2021. So the data will reflect only till the same period.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
